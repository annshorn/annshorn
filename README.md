# Hi, I'm Anna Anikina!

📚 **Education:**

:white_circle: **2022 - Present: PhD Student at the University of Copenhagen**
- I am currently engaged in the field of artificial intelligence in medicine.
- My project focuses on the use of eye-tracking technologies to predict diagnostic errors by radiologists.

More details can be read in the following articles:
- [Recognition of radiological decision errors from eye movement during chest x-ray readings](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12929/3006781/Recognition-of-radiological-decision-errors-from-eye-movement-during-chest/10.1117/12.3006781.full#_=_)

:white_circle: **2018 - 2020: Master in Information Science and Technology (Skoltech)**
- During my master's program, I focused on Parkinson's Disease.
- Collaborated with colleagues to develop an automatic diagnostic system for the disease using machine learning.
